# Virtualization Concepts

## Introduction to Virtual Machines
Virtualization allows a single physical computer to run multiple operating systems (OS) as **virtual machines (VMs)**. Each VM operates as an independent system with its own OS, memory, and storage, but it shares the underlying hardware of the host machine. This technology is widely used in cloud computing, software development, and IT infrastructure.

### Benefits of Virtual Machines:
- Cost-effective: Reduces the need for multiple physical machines.
- Efficient Resource Utilization: Maximizes CPU, RAM, and storage usage.
- Isolation: Each VM runs independently, preventing system conflicts.
- Snapshot & Cloning: Easy to take backups and restore previous states.

## Types of Virtualization
1. **Server Virtualization**  
   - Runs multiple virtual servers on a single physical machine.
   - Example: VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V.

2. **Network Virtualization**  
   - Combines network resources to appear as a single, unified network.
   - Example: Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

3. **Storage Virtualization**  
   - Pools multiple physical storage devices into a single logical unit.
   - Example: Storage Area Networks (SAN).

## Key Virtualization Terminologies
- **Host OS:** The main operating system running on the physical machine.
- **Guest OS:** The OS installed on a virtual machine.
- **Hypervisor:** Software that creates and manages virtual machines.
- **Snapshot:** A saved state of a VM that can be restored at any time.

## Types of Hypervisors
Hypervisors are classified into two types based on their architecture:

1. **Type 1 (Bare Metal Hypervisors)**  
   - Runs directly on the physical hardware without a host OS.
   - Used in enterprise and data center environments.
   - **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.

2. **Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisors)**  
   - Runs as software on an existing operating system.
   - Used for development and testing purposes.
   - **Examples:** Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.

By understanding these virtualization concepts, we gain a strong foundation for working with cloud computing, DevOps, and IT infrastructure management.
